# Mitigation Sheets

If you want to contribute your own mitigation sheet, feel free to submit a ticket so we can review it and add it.

## !!! ⚠️  DISCLAIMER ⚠️   !!!
### These are made by the community and with that personal preference of those people. The Mitigation Plans have worked for those people and in PF but that doesn't mean they work for everything and everyone. 
### Nobody needs to follow these sheets and everyone can make their own changes, but if you do make changes make sure to communitcate that with your party to avoid confusion and unnecessary wipes.
