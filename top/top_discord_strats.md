People mostly use AM for P3 Intermission and anything in P5.

## Position Priority
Position Priority: For the sake of consistency with raidplans. These are interchangeable but are recommended as standard positions. Communicate before pulling.

H1 - Regen Healer
H2 - Barrier Healer
R1 - Physical Ranged
R2 - Magical Ranged

## __Phase 5: Dynamis Omega M & Dynamis Omega F__
### General Information
For 90 second cooldown raidwide mitigation (Prange, Tank) use them when the second tankbuster hit. That way you can mitigate all three big raidwides) 
In PLD + GNB Setup Healers have to help the Tanks for the 3rd and 4th Tankbusters. (3rd: GNB Full -> PLD needs Help - 4th: PLD Full - GNB Needs Help)
Pulling the bosses out a bit after the tankbusters is done so that the boss teleports to the middle giving a small amount of additional time to hit them.

For Close Glitch: Stand in the Middle of the tower
For Far Glitch: Stand on the outer edge of the tower as far as possible

## __Phase 6: Alpha Omega__
### Toolbox / Raidplan
https://raidplan.io/plan/mh3bX4KJ9d8rT9nk
This is for the spreads on Wacecanon 1, Wave Cannon 2 and meteors
### General Positions by Mechanic
**Cosmo Memory** - Party starts in front of C after MT inbetween A and Middle, OT outside on sth like B (just away from party)
**Cosmo Arrow 1 into Cosmo Dive 1** - Party starts in front of 2 and starts with in/out - Party ends in front of 2 again. Tanks start on 2 as well and MT ends up close to the boss in the 4 marker direction, OT in the 1 marker direction.
**Exajoels 1 into Wave Canon 1** - Stay a bit outside, see where you have to go, then group middle, dodge to the safespot and follow the exajoels. After that: See Raidplan on where to spread for WC1. After Beams went off, everyone stack in front of C.
**Cosmo Arrow 2 into Wave Canon 2** - Positions and dodges are based on the marker and your role (see Raidplan) after last dodge wait for the spread beams to go off, then infront of C again.
**Exajoels 2 into Cosmo Dive 2** - Party will end up outside the hitbox where the last Joel exploded. MT will go through the boss to the left, OT will go through the boss to the right. Endposition is like a **Y** shape.
**Meteors** - WC1 Spreadpositions but MT and Prange swap and also H2 and OT swap (see Raidplan)

Its called joel because its a ringaround movement. <a:Joel:1072369917476732968>

# Things that are generally nice to know

# READ THIS IF YOU'RE A MELEE PLAYER
IF YOU HAVE TO LB FIRST IN P6 ON COSMO DIVE 2
*YOU CHECK THE LB BAR*
IF ITS NOT FULL, YOU WAIT A BIT, THEN LB


## TOP DAMAGE DOWN IS 90% - WALL AS SOON AS MECHS ARE RESOLVED

# __Post 7.0 changes due to faster killtimes__

## Tank Combinations with Paladin

Due to fast kill times, Phase 1 and Phase 2 have to be played different, so Paladins are still allowed into TOP.
If the community likes those changes in general, they can be adapted for all tank comps in the future.

### Phase 1:

Tanks will Split and Kitchensink the Tankbusters. MT NW - OT NE

### Phase 2:

**POSITIONS STAY THE SAME! - MT starts left (male) OT starts right (female)** 

### In PLD Setup:
Non-PLD Tank aggros both male and female (just with damage) and invulns the tankbuster. (PLD stance off start of P2 - reactivate before taunt!)
After Tankbusters: MT taunts Female, OT taunts Male.

Video PLD MT PoV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB5vkSFCcjA

### In Non-PLD Setup:
MT aggros both male and female (just with damage) and invulns the tankbuster. (OT stance off start of P2 - reactivate before taunt!)
After/during Tankbusters: MT taunts Female, OT taunts Male.
