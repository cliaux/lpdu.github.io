# General Overview

Twintania's phase consists of 3 mini phases, with each phase consisting of a small loop of mechanics.
These mini phases are based on Twintania's Hp% and will end once she is pushed past 74%, 44% and 0% respectively.
The end of each miniphase will be marked by a Neurolink drop.
These Neurolinks will be dropped on A, then B and lastly C.

# Twintania's Abilities:

**Plummet**: Cleave, dealing significant physical damage to its target.

**Twister**: At the end of its cast, Twintania will place small tornadoes under players. Must move away at the end of the cast, as running into any of the small tornadoes results in instant death, and knock back any nearby players into the death wall.

**Fireball**: Twintania will mark a player with a red triangle, and throw a fireball dealing significant magic damage that can be shared amongst the party.

**Death Sentence**: Tankbuster dealing heavy physical damage to its target, and inflicting a Slashing Vulnerability up. A tank swap is virtually required during the cast.

**Neurolink**: Neurolinks are small puddles you can stand in.  Standing inside of a neurolink will inflict players with a Neurolink status, heavily reducing their damage dealt and heavily reducing damage taken from hatches. Taking a hatch outside of a Neurolink will cause a Wipe. 

**Generate**: A hatch (purple sphere) will appear under Twintania, and a random DPS will be marked. The hatch will slowly move toward said player. If a player is not standing in a Neurolink, the hatch will explode on the whole raid, dealing lethal damage. If soaked in a neurolink, the hatch will explode in a large aoe (about the size of a twister), dealing menial damage to players inside a neurolink, and lethal damage to other players caught in the blast. Getting hit by a Hatch will inflict Mana Hypersensitivity, which will cause a second hatch to always deal lethal damage. 

**Liquid Hell (Distance)**: Targetted aoe on a player, placing a fire puddle under them. Standing in the puddle will inflict a lethal burn dot. Twintania will always target a random player 15-25 yalm away for these baits.

**Liquid Hell (Target)**: Twintania will target a completely random player (excluding current tank) and shoot 5 liquid hells at them, regardless of their distance. This cannot be baited.
