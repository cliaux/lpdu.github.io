# General Overview

Twintania's phase consists of 3 mini phases, with each phase consisting of a small loop of mechanics.
These mini phases are based on Twintania's Hp% and will end once she is pushed past 74%, 44% and 0% respectively.
The end of each miniphase will be marked by a Neurolink drop.
These Neurolinks will be dropped on A, then B and lastly C.

# Twintania's Abilities:

**Plummet**: Cleave, dealing significant physical damage to its target.

**Twister**: At the end of its cast, Twintania will place small tornadoes under players. Must move away at the end of the cast, as running into any of the small tornadoes results in instant death, and knock back any nearby players into the death wall.

**Fireball**: Twintania will mark a player with a red triangle, and throw a fireball dealing significant magic damage that can be shared amongst the party.

**Death Sentence**: Tankbuster dealing heavy physical damage to its target, and inflicting a Physical Vulnerability up. A tank swap is virtually required during the cast.

**Neurolink**: Neurolinks are small puddles you can stand in.  Standing inside of a neurolink will inflict players with a Neurolink status, heavily reducing their damage dealt and heavily reducing damage taken from hatches. Taking a hatch outside of a Neurolink will cause a Wipe.
