[TITLE] LPDU Rules 3

1. **No hate speech.** 
This rule should be considered common sense.


2. **No drama.** 
This includes personal conflicts including but not limited to being blacklisted by someone


3. **Maintain Respectful Communication.** 
No need to trash-talk your raid buddies. Banter is allowed, but if it's clear that it goes beyond banter the staff will intervene and action.


4. **You are not entitled to a clear.** 
If a party encounter goes awry, refrain from lashing out at users in LPDU.


5. **Ensure you ping appropriately.** 
When posting a PF, ensure you only ping a single role and ensure the PF has proper tags. Prog for prog and no [Duty Complete], Clear Party for clearing (no adds to clear etc or C4U) and no [Duty Complete], and Reclears for Reclear/Totem with [Duty Complete] set. Ensure you have a verified clear from <#945725212073295922> before pinging Reclears.


6. **The #strats are just standards.** 
You are free to use any strats you wish, but please indicate this in your descriptions. #strats-discussion also may be used to talk about adjustments in LPDU strats.


7. **Criticism is Allowed**. 
We allow users to give constructive feedback towards other users in their respective encounter channels. However, if the feedback isn't constructive, you should refrain from posting it. @'ing someone for inflammatory purposes is prohibited.


8. **Party leaders can do anything.** 
It's their party, their decisions. If they choose to remove anyone for any reason, they have the authority to do so. We do not moderate parties and their internal dynamics.


9. **Recruit in recruitment channels.** 
When forming a party, please use the appropriate PF recruitment channels. Avoid pinging outside of those designated channels. Static recruitment must be contained in static recruitment, and please refrain from pinging roles in static recruitment.


10. **LPDU is not intended for mature content**. 
Therefore, keep discussions on mature topics safe. This means that memes, pictures, "gooning" and the like of a sexualized nature are prohibited within any of the channels in LPDU. 


11. **Avoid seeking loopholes in the rules.**  
If you're unsure about whether your actions violate the rules, it likely does. Exploiting or bending the rules is also a violation. On top of this, persisting in an action after a moderator or support instructs you to stop, even if done later, is considered a rule violation.


Note that staff has the final say and should be respected.
