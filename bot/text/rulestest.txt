[TITLE] LPDU Rules
:one: **No hate speech** 
Avoid using any form of discriminatory language which goes against but not limited to race, religion, gender and so forth. 
This extends to dog whistles, where users are trying to get around this rule by using vague expressions.
Even while bantering with friends hate speech is not welcome here.

:two: **No drama** 
This includes but is not limited to
* personal conflicts like being blacklisted by someone or getting kicked from a party
* If the Party Leader chooses to remove anyone for any reason, they have the authority to do so
* lashing out in a rude manner for a party encounter going the wrong way
* drama from outside of LPDU to blatantly provoke other users
LPDU is not a place for you to hash out your personal drama

:three: **Maintain Respectful Communication** 
We all understand that heated situations happen, but no matter the situation attempt to retain respectful communication. 
Insulting users just for the sake of insulting them is not desired behaviour.

:four: **Ensure you ping appropriately** 
When posting a PF, ensure you only ping a single role and ensure the PF has proper tags. Here's a quick rundown of the Pings:
* @Prog for prog and no [Duty Complete]
* @Clear Party for clearing (no adds to clear etc or C4U) have [Duty Completion] and no [Duty Complete]
* @Reclears for reclear/totem with [Duty Complete] set. Ensure you have a verified clear from #verification-also-old before pinging reclears.
* If you want to post a C4U party feel free to do so but do not ping any role

:five: **Criticism is Allowed** 
We allow users to give constructive feedback towards other users in their respective encounter channels. 
However, if the feedback isn't constructive, you should refrain from posting it. @'ing someone for inflammatory purposes is prohibited, and rule 3 must be adhered to.
Also be open to feedback and criticism you might receive. Not every negative feedback/criticism is inflammatory or a personal attack and take it as advice on how to improve.

:six: **Recruit in recruitment channels** 
When forming a party, please use the appropriate PF recruitment channels. Avoid pinging outside of those designated channels. 
Static recruitment must be contained in static recruitment, and please refrain from pinging roles in static recruitment.

:seven: **LPDU is not intended for mature content** 
While we do allow posting GPoses within reason, LPDU isn't a place for mature content.
This means that any form of sexualized content whether XIV related or not is strictly prohibited.
In regards to GPosing, even unmodded vanilla bikini pin-up shots are considered NSFW.

:eight: **Avoid seeking loopholes in the rules**  
If you're unsure about whether your actions violate the rules, it's best not to proceed forward. 
Exploiting or bending the rules is also considered a violation. Persisting in an action after a moderator or support instructs you to stop, even if done later, is considered a rule violation.
If you are caught trying to circumvent a rule in such manner it will be seen as direct infraction of said rule.

:asterisk: Note that staff has the final say and should be respected.
