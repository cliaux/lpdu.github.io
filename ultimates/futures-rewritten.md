## Position Priority
Position Priority: For the sake of consistency with raidplans. These are interchangeable but are recommended as standard positions. Communicate before pulling.

H1 - Regen Healer
H2 - Barrier Healer
R1 - Physical Ranged
R2 - Magical Ranged

## Positions throughout the fight
This will be your main spread positions throughout the entirety of the fight (if needed)

                             MT

          R1                                   R2

H1                                                       OT

          M1                                 M2

                           H2

## Color coded mechanics
Some mechanics resolve by playing within your designated color. Those are also your pairs for the fight.

Those are either done in pairs or in light parties.

__Pairs__
MT + R1: Red
H1 + M1: Purple
OT + R2: Yellow
H2 + M2: Blue

__Light parties__
Group 1: Red + Purple 
Group 2: Yellow + Blue
If not color coded then G1 left, G2 right
